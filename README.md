 This program allows to control the LED lighting (motherboard* and headers) on select MSI boards. Unlike MSI Mystic Light, there is no limitation to only 7 colours. Aside from providing a GUI for quickly experimenting with different effects, it also provides a scripting interface to create more advanced effects like [this one](#example-effects) and to auto-run these effects on Windows start-up.

 MSIRGB runs on Windows 10 (x64 only), so long as VC Redist 2017 x64 is installed and .NET support is enabled (which it is, by default). Older versions of Windows have not been tested.

 Download is available [here](#how-to-install). **Check if your motherboard is supported. [I provide no warranty should your motherboard malfunction.](#license)**
 
 This project began as a port of [nagisa/msi-rgb](https://github.com/nagisa/msi-rgb) for Windows, but eventually evolved to have a more Windows user-friendly interface, both visually and in the creation of effects, but it is still heavily based on exposing the hardware-implemented LED functionality through which the user can create those effects.
 
\* It has been reported to affect all motherboard LEDs as well, but I do not guarantee it.
 
# How it works
![MSIRGB](media/main_window.PNG)

When you run MSIRGB, you will see this GUI. Here you can experiment with simple effects by changing hardware-implemented settings in your motherboard.

- **Colours**: You can choose to change between 8 different colours. The order by which the motherboard switches between them is from left to right as displayed. You can choose from 4096 different colours (unfortunately, this is a hardware limitation).

- **Step duration**: This is the interval of time between each change of colour. Possible values are 0 to 511, inclusive. The unit of time is unknown.

- **Breathing mode**: This is one of the two flashing modes supported by all the motherboards that MSIRGB targets. Breathing mode flashes from on to off and back again by gradually changing brightness. The speed of this effect cannot be changed.

- **Flashing mode**: This other flashing mode flashes from on to off and back again instantly, and the speed of the effect can be changed to different preset values.

- **Scripts**: Scripts allow you to leverage these hardware-implemented functions to create more advanced effects. While the functionality provided by the motherboard seems minimal, you can create some interesting effects with them. Currently MSIRGB has 4 example effects you can download and try: the [hue wheel effect](#example-effects), the strobe effect, the police lights effect, and the pumpkin effect. New effects are always welcome. Feel free to open a pull request if you'd like to contribute.

# How to install
 1. Check if your motherboard is supported [here](#motherboard-support). If it is, you may proceed. If it isn't, it's possible the program won't work with your motherboard. Other MSI motherboards may be supported despite not being listed. Non-MSI motherboards are not supported and MSIRGB will not run on those.
 2. Install [VC Redist 2017 x64](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
 3. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ixjf/MSIRGB/releases/download/v2.2.1.2/MSIRGB-v2.2.1.2.7z).
 4. Download the [latest example effects](https://github.com/ixjf/MSIRGB/releases/download/scripts-v2.2.0/MSIRGB-Scripts.7z).
 5. Unpack the archive from 3. into any folder, then create a "Scripts" folder in that same directory and unpack the archive from 4. there, such that your directory structure is like this:
    - Scripts/
        - Hue Wheel.lua
        - ...
    - ...
    - MSIRGB.exe
 6. Run MSIRGB.exe. It'll ask you for administrator privileges. This is required to access the hardware.

 **It is still possible to use this program with any motherboard that isn't listed above or in section [Motherboard support](#motherboard-support), but do it at your own risk.**

 # How to build
 1. Install Visual Studio 2017 (any edition) with C++ desktop development tools, C# and WPF support, and Blend for .NET. The project is currently set to use the Windows 10 SDK build 17663, but it should work with any other.
 2. Open the solution (MSIRGB.sln)
 3. Select debug/release target & build.
